## ADR-0001: Programming Language Selection

### Context

As usual while starting we need to decide on a programming language to use for development.

### Decision

I will use Java as the primary programming language for the project.

### Reasoning

The choice of programming language is not critical for this project. 
However, I have more experience and proficiency in Java, and I want to leverage that expertise, and I'm applying as a Java developer.

### Consequences

The use of Java will likely make development faster and easier, given my existing proficiency with the language. 
However, it's worth noting that other languages could have been chosen and the final solution would have been similar.
