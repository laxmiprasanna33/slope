Sort students by performance (recruitment task)

```
Hi Damian,

When you receive this task we would be grateful if you could send a one line email to confirm receipt of the task.
Please read the task carefully and concentrate only on the functionality which is required to get done.
We will be reviewing your code which must be done in a maintainable and reusable manner. To have a properly functioning system would take 8-10 hours of work on this task.

We suggest you spend around 2 - 4 hours on this, therefore we DO NOT expect it to be completed or to be functionable, but WE DO EXPECT it to indicate that you have approached the requirements correctly.

We are interested in the quality of your code, your capability of design.

IMPORTANT: A fully functioning design which has been rushed to completion is not the goal of this exercise.

If you wish to continue and spend more than 4 hours and complete the assignment then you may do so. But please ensure that you deliver a version after 4 hours, and then the completed application.
Assignment

We need an application to sort students by their performance.
System UI can be written using any framework you are familiar with, but It must allow the user to select a text file with student data, sorting algorithm and display the result in a table with an option to save it to a file.
As we are not sure how many students will have to be sorted, we would like you to implement Bubble, Heap and Merge sorting algorithms, but enable system design to be easily extendable in future.

To simplify benchmarking we would like to see a number of records and sorting time.
Input file example:


Student1,8.5
Student2,6.5
Student3,5.0

Wishing you good luck with the Assignment
